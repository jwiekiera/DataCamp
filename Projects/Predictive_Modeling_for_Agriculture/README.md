# Predictive Modeling for Agriculture
*This is my solution to project from DataCamp.* 

Identify the single feature that has the strongest predictive performance for classifying crop types.

* Find the feature in the dataset that produces the best score for predicting `"crop"`.
* From this information, create a variable called `best_predictive_feature`, which:
  - Should be a `dictionary` containing the best predictive feature name as a key and the evaluation score (for the metric you chose) as the value.
